# MyLittleBoatloader

First and foremost, I want to make it clear that this is a "non-project." I'm not sure if that's the exact term, but my goal with this isn't to innovate bootloaders. I'm simply going to upload my bootloaders here, aiming to showcase my progress in this study and, if possible, help someone. When I create a relatively 'cool' bootloader, I intend to make a complete post about the subject.

**With this goal in mind, I ask that you overlook the fact that some code may be extremely poorly optimized. I don't intend to alter the bootloaders already posted, only to improve them in the next version =D**

(And I also don't intend to keep changing the readme image for every new bootloader that gets posted.)
