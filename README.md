# MyLittleBoatloader

Firstly, I want to make it clear that this is a 'non-project.' I'm not sure if that's the exact term, but my goal with this isn't to innovate bootloaders. I'm simply going to upload my bootloaders here, aiming to showcase my progress in this study and, if possible, to help someone. When I create a relatively 'cool' bootloader, I plan to make a complete post about the subject.
